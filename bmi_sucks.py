    As we all know, BMI is THE most accurate way of calculating obesity.
    That is, if you ignore any kind of muscle mass, health conditions, body types...
    In other words, it's society's way of bullying people!
    Hooray!!!

    Side note: I'm obese according to my BMI calculations, so do with that information what you will.
    As we all know, I am the textbook definition of obese.

    Sorry, I'll cut the sarcasm now. Here's the assignment:
    The user will enter their weight in pounds(lbs) and their height in inches(in).
    The program's job is to calculate lbs into kg and in into m.

    1 lb = 0.453592 kg
    1 in = 0.0254 m

    Then, using the BMI formula, we calculate what ranges they fall into.

    bmi = weight / (height ** 2)

    Oh, and this is a scope assignment. Time for me to figure out what the heck that means.
