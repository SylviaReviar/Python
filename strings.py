"""
    oh god spring break is over as of tomorrow. Sorry it took me so long to get to this...
    I wore myself down trying to rush on my game development project, beating myself up and drawing
    over and over like my life depended on it
    ended up giving myself HUUUUUGE headaches...
    and i crashed out HARD. even now, I'm fighting through another headache to try and get this done.

    The assignment says to complete the code given to us by Meri.
    Where it says T O D O: I have to follow the instructions. (I spaced them out because they changed color)
    (I didn't want to change the code by accident by having something in my docstring...)

    here goes everything I guess

    ...never mind my brain isn't working. I'm waiting til tomorrow...
