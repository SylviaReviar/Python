    Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's Mad-Libs!

    (If you can't think of people to input to test the story, then go ahead and use fictional characters)
    And yes, this is named (and written) after Yu-Gi-Oh! World Championships 2009: Stardust Accelerator.
    Yes, I'm a huge nerd. And yes, this is the weirdest thing I've submitted to a professor.
    I am describing an anime to you. The concept is not mine. It's bizarre and takes itself way too seriously.
    And I think that's funny.
